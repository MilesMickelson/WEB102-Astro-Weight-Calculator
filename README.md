# WEB102-Astro-Weight-Calculator

![](images/ProjectScreenshot.png)

My very first project in the San Diego Code School coursework. Allows a person to enter their bodyweight, 
select a planet, and use a button to submit their input for a calculation of how much that person would weigh on that planet.

## Please feel free to demo the project by taking these steps..
```
Clone or fork the repo
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```
```
Open your browser to view on localhost: 3000
